# DSA: Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my Personal **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository.  

This repo contains **clean, well-structured solutions** to a wide range of DSA problems, primarily implemented in **C++**, with plans to expand into **JavaScript** later.  

## 📌 Purpose
- Serve as a **personal practice hub** for coding sessions and interview prep  
- Provide a **revision log** whenever I revisit a question  
- Maintain an organized collection of solutions for quick reference  

## ⚠️ Note
This repository is intended for **personal learning and practice**.  
It is **not meant as a teaching resource or someones guide** or reference guide for others.

*Just a learner documenting the journey through DSA.*
